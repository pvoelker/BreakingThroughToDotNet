These examples show several COM interop concepts and techniques for .NET:

-- Example 1 - Basic COM interop and .NET exception handling
-- Example 2 - Weakly and strongly typed collections, with timings
-- Example 3 - Event mechanism and conversion of .NET delegate events to COM callbacks
-- Example 4 - User interface integration (via ActiveX)

Visual C++ 2012 and Visual C# 2012 are required to build these examples.
